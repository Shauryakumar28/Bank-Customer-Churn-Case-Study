# Bank-Customer-Churn-Case-Study: Predicting Bank Customer Churn with Machine Learning

This project tackled the critical issue of customer churn in the banking industry. We leveraged Python, Pandas and machine learning to develop a robust model for:

# Identifying Flight Risks:
The model predicts which customers are at a high risk of leaving the bank, allowing proactive interventions.
# Intelligent Data Handling:
We addressed imbalanced data, a common challenge in churn prediction, using both under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. The data was then meticulously encoded and scaled for optimal analysis and model performance.
# Optimizing the Model:
We employed Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and utilized hyperparameter tuning to fine-tune the model, ensuring the best possible accuracy in predicting churn.

This project goes beyond basic churn prediction. By applying advanced machine learning techniques and meticulous data preparation, we aimed to provide banks with a powerful tool to retain valuable customers and minimize churn.
